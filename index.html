      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a graphic designer for a small, family&dash;owned company.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Devine, Tx</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Video Games, Drawing and Cooking.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>To be a front-end developer.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>

      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I have been teaching myself code since I had a MySpace page and want to keep developing my skills to build larger and more grand designs. I have built several web pages from the ground up, but have only delt with the front-end portion. Learning some of the backend processes will help me become a stronger developer and more confident in my skills. <br> </p>
